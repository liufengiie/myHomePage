		<strong>Optimizing interconnections to maximize the spectral radius of 
		interdependent networks</strong><br />
		The spectral radius (i.e., the largest eigenvalue) of the adjacency 
		matrices of complex networks is an important quantity that governs the 
		behavior of many dynamic processes on the networks, such as 
		synchronization and epidemics. Studies in the literature focused on 
		bounding this quantity. In this paper, we investigate how to maximize 
		the spectral radius of interdependent networks by optimally 
		linking&nbsp;k&nbsp;internetwork connections (or interconnections for short). We 
		derive formulas for the estimation of the spectral radius of 
		interdependent networks and employ these results to develop a suite of 
		algorithms that are applicable to different parameter regimes. In 
		particular, a simple algorithm is to link the&nbsp;k&nbsp;nodes with the 
		largest&nbsp;k&nbsp;eigenvector centralities in one network to the node in the 
		other network with a certain property related to both networks. We 
		demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms via extensive 
		simulations. We discuss the physical implications of the results, 
		including how the optimal interconnections can more effectively decrease 
		the threshold of epidemic spreading in the 
		susceptible-infected-susceptible model and the threshold of 
		synchronization of coupled Kuramoto oscillators. </td>

		<p align="justify"><strong>A Secret Enriched Visual Cryptography</strong></p>
		<p>Visual Cryptography (VC) is a powerful technique that combines the 
		notions of perfect ciphers and secret sharing in cryptography with that 
		of raster graphics. A binary image can be divided into shares that are 
		able to be stacked together so as to approximately recover the original 
		image. VC is a unique technique in the sense that the encrypted message 
		can be decrypted directly by the Human Visual System (HVS). The 
		distinguishing characteristic of VC is the ability of secret restoration 
		without the use of computation. However because of restrictions of the 
		HVS, pixel expansion and alignment problems, a VC scheme perhaps can 
		only be applied to share a small size of secret image. In this paper, we 
		propose a general method to let the VC shares carry more secrets, the 
		technique is to use cypher output of private-key systems as the input 
		random numbers of VC scheme, meanwhile the encryption key could be 
		shared, the shared keys could be associated with the VC shares. After 
		this operation, VC scheme and secret sharing scheme are merged with the 
		private-key system. Under this design, we implement a $(k,t,n)$-VC 
		scheme. Compared to those existing schemes, our approach could greatly 
		enhance the ability of current VC schemes and could cope with pretty 
		rich secrets.</td>

		In order to reduce the pixel expansion of Visual Cryptography Scheme 
		(VCS), many size invariant visual cryptography schemes (SIVCS's) were 
		proposed. However, most of the known SIVCS's have bad visual quality and 
		thin line problems, hence the known SIVCS's are only suitable to encrypt 
		coarse secret images. In this paper, we notice that the variance of the 
		darkness levels of the pixels also reflects the visual quality of the 
		recovered secret image, as well as the average contrast. We verify, 
		analytically and experimentally, the effectiveness of the variance to be 
		a criterion for evaluating the visual quality of the recovered secret 
		image. Furthermore, we propose two multi-pixel encryption size invariant 
		visual cryptography schemes (ME-SIVCS's) which improve the visual 
		quality of the recovered secret image by reducing the variance of the 
		darkness levels. In addition, the proposed ME-SIVCS's can be used to 
		encrypt fine secret images since they avoid some known thin line 
		problems. Experimental results and comparisons are also given to show 
		the effectiveness of the proposed ME-SIVCS's. Finally, we give 
		suggestions on obtaining good visual quality for the recovered secret

		<span lang="en-us">For visual cryptography scheme (VCS), normally, the

		Two common drawbacks of visual cryptography scheme (VCS) are the large

		(2,2)-VCS recursively, where a participant may receive multiple share

		VCSX_OR which have optimal pixel expansion and contrast for each

		However, most papers in the literature are dedicated to reduce pixel

		Cheating Immune Visual Cryptography Scheme</span><b><br>
		</b><br />Most cheating immune visual cryptography schemes (CIVCS) are 
		based on a traditional visual cryptography scheme (VCS), and are 
		designed to avoid cheating when the secret image of the original VCS is 
		to be recovered. However all the known CIVCS have some drawbacks. Most 
		usual drawbacks include the following: Either the scheme needs an online 
		trusted authority, or it requires additional shares for the purpose of 
		verification, or it has to sacrifice the properties by means of pixel 
		expansion and contrast reduction of the original VCS, or it can only be 
		based on such VCS with specific access structures. In this paper, we
